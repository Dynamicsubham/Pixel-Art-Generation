# Pixel Art Generation Using GAN
This project explores the generation of pixel art using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It provides a prototype demonstrating how to train a GAN model and predict the actual output.

Files

    GAN.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the prototype code for training the GAN model and generating pixel art.
    generated/: Directory containing generated pixel art images.
    generated.avi: Animation showing the generation process of pixel art.
    G.pth: Generator model weights.
    D.pth: Discriminator model weights.
    PixelArt Dataset: Dataset consisting of 89k images. The dataset files are not included in the repository, but a link to download them will be provided.


Usage

Jupyter Notebook: Open the GAN.ipynb notebook to explore the prototype code for training the GAN model and generating pixel art. Follow the instructions within the notebook to train the model and generate pixel art images.
Generated Images: The generated/ directory contains the generated pixel art images. You can view these images to observe the output of the trained GAN model.
Animation: The generated.avi file is an animation showing the generation process of pixel art images. You can play the animation to visualize how the GAN model generates pixel art.
Model Weights: The G.pth and D.pth files contain the weights of the trained Generator and Discriminator models, respectively. These weights can be used to load the trained models for further experimentation or generation of pixel art.
Dataset
The PixelArt Dataset used for training the GAN model consists of 89k images. However, the dataset files are not included in this repository. You can download the dataset from the following link: [Pixel Art Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ebrahimelgazar/pixel-art)

Note
This project serves as a prototype for generating pixel art using GANs. Further experimentation and refinement may be required for more robust pixel art generation. Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the code to suit your needs. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
